        <h1>About Me⚡</h1>
        <p>Greetings! I'm Aitana Hierro, a driven professional with a passion for the intersection of Product Management and Data Analytics. Currently, I am on an exciting journey pursuing a technical Business Analytics Masters at Santa Clara University, immersing myself in courses that sharpen my skills in database management, data analytics, machine learning, and more.</p>
        
        <p>In my 5+ years of diverse business experience, I've honed my leadership skills by heading teams of 15+ individuals, employing data-driven and agile methodologies to drive success. My most recent role at Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, CA, saw me take charge as a Product/Partner Success Associate. There, I spearheaded the development of a Data Analytics product, resulting in an impressive 80% customer retention rate. I managed substantial corporate accounts, driving revenue growth and fostering long-term partnerships with esteemed clients such as OPPO, Ecopetrol, Mitsui & Co., Furukawa Electric, among others.</p>
        
        <p>Previously, I co-founded and served as CEO of NEXT JOB SL in Madrid, Spain, where I successfully launched an employment platform for young professionals. The platform generated €130K+ in revenue and established 25+ corporate partnerships with industry leaders like Morningstar, Telefónica, Indra, Mondelez, and more.</p>
        
        <p>In the realm of Product Marketing, I contributed significantly to Class Spain SL, implementing targeted strategies that expanded market share in the Alicante region by 10%. My journey began in sales at Juguetes Industriales S.A. (JUINSA), where I showcased a strong ability to understand customer needs, resulting in a 5% increase in sales volume.</p>
        
        <h2>Education and Skills</h2>
        <p>My educational background includes a Bachelor's Degree in Leadership, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation from Mondragon University (Teamlabs) in Madrid, Spain, where I was honored as the Best Leader of 2019-20. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at Santa Clara University.</p>
        
        <p>My technical skills encompass a range of programming languages such as Python, R, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. In addition, I excel in Product Management, New Product Development, Outbound Product Management, Product Innovation, Data Analytics, Coaching & Mentoring, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Project Management.</p>
        
        <h2>Additional Dimensions</h2>
